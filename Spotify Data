I uploaded Spotify data into SQLLite and queried the data to get results as shown below:

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata;

--1) What is the average popularity for the top 10 tracks?

SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE id<= '10'
;

--2) What is the shortest song with a popularity of 90 or above?

SELECT MIN(duration_ms) as length
, track_name
, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90
ORDER BY track_name
LIMIT 1
;

--3) Who are the top 10 artists by liveliness?

SELECT artist_name
, liveness
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY liveness desc
LIMIT 10
;

--4) What is the average danceability for a Doja Cat song?

SELECT AVG(danceability)
, artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
;

--5) Which artist released the longest song, and what was the name of the song?

SELECT artist_name
, MAX(duration_ms)
, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1
;

--6) What was the average loudness of the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT AVG(loudness)
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

--7) What is the average danceability by artist?

SELECT artist_name
, AVG(danceability)
, AVG(popularity)
, AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
;
